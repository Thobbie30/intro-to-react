QUESTION 4
Notable differences between HTML & JSX
a. Syntax: HTML uses a syntax that is primarily tag-based, while JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code in JavaScript. This means that JSX is more flexible and expressive than HTML.

b. Attributes: In HTML, attributes are specified using a tag-based syntax, while in JSX, they are specified as properties of a JavaScript object. This means that JSX allows for more complex and dynamic attribute values than HTML.

c. Components: JSX is designed to work with React components, which are a key feature of the React framework. HTML does not have a concept of components, and instead relies on a hierarchical structure of nested elements.

QUESTION 5
Why can't browsers read JSX?
Browsers can't read JSX because it is not a standard web language like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Instead, JSX is a syntax extension that needs to be transpiled into plain JavaScript before it can be executed in a browser. This is typically done using a tool like Babel, which converts JSX into JavaScript that can be understood by browsers (that is, browsers can only read and execute standard web languages, and JSX is not one of them.)
